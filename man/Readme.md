How to generate documentation:
================================

## DESCRIPTION

To generate documentation:

1) Start by filling out the 'man-template.md'

2) Then use a program ronn. Get ronn from github.

3) Run ronn:

    $ronn &lt;filename&gt;.md

4)  Remember, we use the following naming convention for files:
    git-&lt;command&gt;.html
    git-&lt;command&gt;.1
    git-&lt;command&gt;.md

    You'll need to rename the html file, as ronn probably inserted a 1 into the filename.

## EXAMPLE

    $ ronn git-effort.md

    roff: ./git-effort.1
    html: ./git-effort.1.html                +man

    $mv git-effort.1.html git-effort.html

## SHELL SCRIPT

Alternatively you can run the `manning-up.sh` automated shell script included in the man folder. The script will recreate the git-extras index based on the list of .md files available before it runs `ronn` against each one to generate the documents as well as renaming the generated `.html` files to their desired form.

    $ ./manning-up.sh

To only (re)generate a specific .md manual template and have `.1.html` renamed to `.html` yau may also use manning-up.sh.

    $ ./manning-up.sh git-info.md
