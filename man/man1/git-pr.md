=================================

## SYNOPSIS

`git-pr` &lt;number&gt; [&lt;remote&gt;]<br>

  that branch afterwards.

## EXAMPLES

This checks out the pull request `226` from `origin`:

    $ git pr 226

    remote: Counting objects: 12, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
    remote: Total 12 (delta 3), reused 9 (delta 3)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (12/12), done.
    From https://github.com/tj/git-extras
     * [new ref]         refs/pull/226/head -> pr/226

    Switched to branch 'pr/226'

This pulls from a different remote:

    $ git pr 226 upstream

To clean up old branches:

    $ git pr clean
  
    Deleted branch pr/226 (was b96a8c2).
    Deleted branch pr/220 (was d34dc0f).
