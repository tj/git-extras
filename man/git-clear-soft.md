git-clear-soft(1) -- Soft clean up of a repository
================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`git-clear-soft`

  Clears the repository to a state that it looks as if it was freshly cloned

  deletion of all untracked files that reside inside the working directory, excluding those in .gitignore.
